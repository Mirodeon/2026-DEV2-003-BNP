# Tic Tac Toe – Android Code Kata


## Context

This project is an Android code kata developed as part of a technical interview process.
The goal is not to build a complex game or a polished UI, but to demonstrate software craftsmanship,
code quality, and reasoning through a simple and well-known problem.


## Objective

The objective of this kata is to implement a Tic Tac Toe game while focusing on:
- clear domain modeling
- separation of responsibilities
- test-driven development
- readable and maintainable code

The game rules themselves are intentionally simple in order to keep the focus on design and code quality.


## Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android ViewModel
- JUnit (unit tests)


## Design
## How to Run
## Tests
## Development Approach

This repository history reflects the incremental steps taken during development.
Each change was committed with the intent to keep the evolution of the solution readable,
rather than squashing commits into a single final state.


## Possible Improvements

- Support for different board sizes
- Improved error feedback in the UI
- Optional AI opponent
